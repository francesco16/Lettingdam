# Lettingdam

A React project for a letting agency.

## Styling 
I have used **SCSS** with **Mixins** to style the page. 

## Data
I’m retrieving data from **Contentful** using their **Content Delivery API** to manipulate it and make it available troughout the components via the **React Context API**.

## Notes
Please be aware that this is not production code! I’m just demonstrating different techniques for similar tasks (ex. using both **Classes** with **Lifecycle Events** and **Functions** with **Hooks**).

Thanks for your time!
